Since `3FW1` is the only structure in our dataset representing not a kinase, we are content that our similarity measure was able to spot this. As discussed before, the human quinone reductase 2 (`3FW1`) is a reported off-target for Imatinib.\n",
        "- Also the kinase `1XBB` shows a higher dissimilarity compared to the other kinases. This can be explained by `1XBB` being resolved in a different conformation (DFG-in) than the other kinases (DFG-out). The DFG motif is an important structural element in kinases, defining whether a kinase is active (DFG-in conformation) or inactive (DFG-out conformation). Note: DFG conformations of kinase structures can be looked up e.g. in the [KLIFS database](https://www.klifs.net).\n",
