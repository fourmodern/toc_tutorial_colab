Each grid point is then scanned in seven direction (along the x, y and z axes as well as the four cubic diagonals) and the number of Protein-Solvent-Protein (PSP) events per point is stored (# rays restricted on both side by the protein). Finally, grid points that are buried (= have a high PSP value) are clustered to pockets.\n",

In case a probe clashes with any nearby atom, its radius is reduced until no overlap occurs. The resulting probes define the cavities.\n",

Then, van der Waals energies between the probe and the protein environment within 8 Å distance are calculated. Grid points with unfavorable energies, i.e., above an energy cut-off based on the mean energy and standard deviation over the whole grid, are discarded. Finally, grid points fulfilling this cut-off are merged to pockets.\n",

The protein is embedded in a Cartesian grid, and each grid point is labeled as either 0 (free) or 1 (occupied), depending on if it lies within any protein atom's van der Waals radius. Then, an edge-detection algorithm from image processing, a **Difference of Gaussian filter** (thus the name DoGSite) is invoked to identify protrusion on the protein surface (i.e. the positions on a protein surface where the location of a sphere-like object is favorable).

        "Potential shortcomings: Such algorithms detect the pockets based on a given protein structure (x-ray). If another structure of the same protein is available, applying the algorithm to that structure might lead to (slightly) different pockets due to e.g. conformational changes induced by the bound ligand. Also differences between apo and holo structures do affect the predictions."
